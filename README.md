# RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1
RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1

The Sonoff RF Bridge is only supporting one protocol with 24 bits.<br/>
The Idea is to write a alternative firmware for the onboard EFM8BB1 chip.

Please take a look in the [wiki](https://github.com/Portisch/RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1/wiki) for more information.

Currently version 3 is getting developed.  
So please use everytime the last .HEX file in the "generic_bucket" branch:
[beta v3](https://github.com/Portisch/RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1/blob/generic_bucket/Keil%208051%20v9.53%20-%20Release/RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1.hex)
